# Base implementation done by SunnyValleyStudio:
https://github.com/SunnyValleyStudio/Unity_Procedural_Dungeon_binary_space_partitioning/tree/master

After analyzing and implementing this solution, we made the following changes

# Floor height

We started by adding a configurable wall script and a floor height so we can decide the height of the walls

then added another generation of floor to act as the ceiling.


# Floor count

Added a variable for floor count to customize the height of the dungeon and generated multiple floors
